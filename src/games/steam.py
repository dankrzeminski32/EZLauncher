# Use the command below to run a Steam game
# subprocess.call(r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe -applaunch 578080")
# 578080 represents the steam ID
# C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\appmanifest_id -> is where you find the steam games and all their id's/information
# We'll need to parse those files for the ids and then use them in the subprocess command
